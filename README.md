# Belle the Twitter Cat

This Javascript app that utilizes the Twitter API is a 'Tamagotchi'-like virtual pet that users can interact with through liking and retweeting its tweets.

### Features:

* Belle Tweets every 3 hours
* 'Like' to pet Belle
* 'Retweet' to play with Belle

### Limitations: 
* Users must be on a public account 
* Belle will only respond to a user once every 30 minutes, so liking or retweeting within 30 minutes of each other will not prompt a response from the bot.

### Work-In-Progress: 

- [x] More possible idle statues (total of 34, 17 statuses with two possible faces each (as of 09/23)
- [ ] MongoDB / Mongoose Support (Belle will remind you if you haven't interacted with her every couple of days)
